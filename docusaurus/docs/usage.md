You need to use ES6's `import` to load the module and use it. Add the following line of code to import it:

```javascript
import console from 'avant-garde';
```

You can now use Avant-garde. Add the following code:

```javascript
console.json({
  a: 1,
  b: 2,
  c: 3,
});
```

Run the code. You should see the object printed in the console with formatting and highlighting.

You can now head over to the [API reference](/docs/api) or the [examples](/docs/examples).
